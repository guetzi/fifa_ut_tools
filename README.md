# fifa_ut_tools
Repository for some tools for FIFA Ultimate Team using the web app. 

Ideas so far:
  - Auto-Relisting
  - Auto-Reinvesting:
      - takes in a list of players (could be from futbing for example, could also consider current futbin prices for search)
      - lists players with a percentage in relation to ea tax and cheapest bin
  - Find valuable players by checking tradeable content in club
  - Send warnings when players have big price drops
